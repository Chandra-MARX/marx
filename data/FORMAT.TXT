The .dat binary files in this directory and its subdirectories consists
of a 32 byte header, followed by a comment section, and finally by the
data.  

The header has the format:

Offset  length   Interpretation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0       4      Magic number: 0x83 0x43 0x59 0x8E
  4       1      Data type: 
                     'A'    8 bit signed integer (character)
		     'I'   16 bit signed integer
		     'J'   32 bit signed integer
		     'E'   32 bit float
		     'F'   64 bit float
  5       4      Number of Rows
  9       4      Number of Columns
 13       4      Comment Length
 17      15      Reserved

The comment section immediately follows the header.
After that, the data follows ordered according to columns.

The .dat files were generated from ASCII tables via tbl2bdat.c and may
be converted back to ASCII via bdat2tbl.c.  See the Makefile.
