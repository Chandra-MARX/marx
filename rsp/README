marxrsp folds a MARX simulation through a FITS RMF file.

marxrsp is not required to use marx, it is an optional tool to help
with calibration.
This tool allows the user to fold the results of a marx simulation
through a FITS response matrix file (RMF). Traditionally, RMF files
are used to describe the response of a given detector such as an ACIS
CCD. The RMF file, also known as a redistribution matrix file,
describes the mapping of photon energy into detected pulse
height. marxrsp reads the energy vector for a group of simulated
events and uses the specified RMF file to calculate the appropriate
pulse height values. By default, marx calculates a pulse height array
(pha.dat) for ACIS simulations using an approximate, builtâ€“in
redistribution function.

marxrsp is a post-processing tool for  marx program
(The marx web page is at <http://space.mit.edu/cxc/marx/>), which provides
exmaples for the use of jdmath.

marxrsp is still under development.  Please send all
comments, modifications, bug reports, or bug fixes to marx-help@space.mit.edu so
that they may be incorporated into the distribution.
