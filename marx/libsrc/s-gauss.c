/* The gaussian distribution use here is defined to be one in which the
 * BRIGHTNESS is distributed with a probability distribution of the form
 * g(r) = exp (-r^2/s^s) where s (sigma) controls the width.
 * Note that g(r)dr is NOT the number of rays with r between r and r + dr.
 * The number of rays with r between r and r + dr is r g(r) dr and the total
 * number of rays within radius r is
 * @
 * @  N(r) = \int_0^r dr r g(r) = 1 - exp(-r^2/s^2)
 * @
 * Inverting this yields:
 * @
 * @  r(N) = s sqrt(log (1/(1 - N(r))))
 * @
 * Note that N(r) is normalized to 1; that is, it is the fractional number.
