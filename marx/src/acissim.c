/* Note:  The code in this file is essentually a complete re-write of the

 * was written in Fortran by Lumb and later modified by Nousek.  The Townsley
 * converted it to Fortran.  It was later converted to C by Bob Zacher.
 * Unfortunately, the original code had some bugs and those bugs were
 * propagated along with each translation.  Finally, the translations
 * themselves introduced new bugs.  The bugs I found were reported to Bob
 * Zacher at SAO.
 *
 * To produce this version, I went back to the original papers that the
 * previous version was based on and rewrote the simulator from scratch
 * by taking the ideas in the original papers as well as the ideas of the
 * Lumb/Nousek/Townsley/Zacher implementation.

/* Background.
 *
 * An xray photon will give up its energy via the photoelectric
 * effect a kick out an electron.  This electron will scatter giving
 * up its energy to electron-hole pairs.  This will happen at some
 * depth in the ccd determined by an energy-dependent absorbtion
 * length calculated below. This gives rise to an initial charge
 * cloud of pairs whose size is energy dependent. The size of the
 * cloud is given in Hopkinson 87 by
 * @  R = 0.5 * 0.0176 E^1.75
 * where E is the energy of the liberated electron.  The electron energy
 * will differ from the XRay energy-- the binding energy of K shell electrons
 * in silicon is 1.78 KeV.
 * The factor of 0.5 is necessary to convert diameter to radius.
 *
 * It is also possible for the initial photon to give rise to a fluorescence
 * photon.  This photon is also included in the simulation.
 *
 * The charge cloud then begins to diffuse until it has reached the channel
 * where it will be ``detected''.  The actual rate of diffusion will depend
 * upon the properties of the layer that it is travelling through.  It is
 * possible for the charge cloud to spread across several pixels before
 * detection.
