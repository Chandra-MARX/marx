This directory contains programs and scripts that are used to make several
of the MARX data input files. Individual scripts are commented.

Here some general remarks
-------------------------
mk_hrma_ea.sl, mkcorr.sl, run_mkarf.sh:
    These scripts make input for the ea-mirror model.
    See Makefile for invocation.
    Since the ea-mirror model should not be used any longer and 
    is of historical interest only, these scripts are not used any more.
    The ea-mirror model stays frozen and **does not** receive regular
    updates; thus, it **does not** follow recent improvments in CALDB.
    Users should use the more accurate HRMA mirror model.
