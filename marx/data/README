The subdirectories of this directory contain instrument specific data
files:

   ./acis
      This directory contains data files used by the ACIS-S and ACIS-I
      detector. It is currently empty, because all required files
      are dereved directly from the CALDB and can thus be found in the 
      ./caldb directory.

   ./caldb
      This directory contains files that are copied over from CALDB
      (so that MARX users don't need a full CALDB isntallation to run
      MARX) or that are derived from CALDB files, e.g. by re-ordering
      as CALDB file.
      This directory also contains a S-Lang script to generate some of
      these files from CALDB.

   ./grating
      This directory contains data files for the HETG and LETG.
      
   ./hrc
      This directory contains data files used by the HRC-S, HRC-I, and
      the HESF (aka Drake Flat).
      
   ./hrma
      This directory contains HRMA specific data files

   ./obs
      This directory contains default parameters that are written to 
      the headers of output fits files to make them look like real
      observations to CIAO.

   ./pixlib
       This directory contains details on the pixel coordinates.      
      
   ./src
      This directory contains the source to dump ASCII data files to a
      from the MARX .dat binary format

There are several file formats used in these directories.  The formats
are distinguished by the filename suffix: 

    .tbl : ASCII data files
    .dat : Binary data files.  Use src/bdatdump to dump them.
    .bin : Misc binary file formats

See FORMAT.TXT for more information about the .dat format.

Some subdirectories contain README files with more details themselves.
