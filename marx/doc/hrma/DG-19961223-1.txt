These are the best available optical constants (current standard results)
for the mirror 065 (P6 Qualification, position A1, off the large end of
P6). The results from other mirrors are to be compared with these
results. The optical constants fitting quality is not to our specification
in the 11215-11224 eV range (Ir L-III edge trough), but the rest of
the fits are acceptable by and large.

No smoothing of the n(E) or k(E) versus energy has been done, so these
are essentially all real data points directly from the fits to the
raw reflectance data. Some weighted averaging has been done for
data points between 2800 and 2900 eV to resolve an overlap error
between two data sets.
