jdmath is a C library for mathematical functions.

It was written for ray-tracing and concentrates on the function for vectors in
3-dimansioan space. There are, for example, functions to rotate a vector, find the
angle between two vectors, form the dor or cross product of vectors and the like.

jdmath  is used in the marx program
(The marx web page is at <http://space.mit.edu/cxc/marx/>), which provides many
exmaples for the use of jdmath.

jdmath is still under development.  Please send all
comments, modifications, bug reports, or bug fixes to marx-help@space.mit.edu so
that they may be incorporated into the distribution.

There is no documentaton on the library.  After building it, you should be
left with a file called `jdmath.h' (and the library!) which is to be included
into any file that uses routines from library.  Look in this file for what
functions are available.
