Note:  Recently Bill Pence released a CFITSIO library.  Since this
library still in a very early development stage, you are encouraged to
use the official CFITSIO library.

This is a C fitsio library that is still under development.  Please send all
comments, modifications, bug reports, or bug fixes to davis@space.mit.edu so
that they may be incorporated into the distribution.

There is no documentaton on the library.  After building it, you should be
left with a file called `jdfits.h' (and the library!) which is to be included
into any file that uses routines from library.  Look in this file for what
functions are available.

See `makefits.c' for an example of using the library to create a fits
file and `fitsdump.c' to read one.
