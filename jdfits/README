jdfits is a C library to read and write fits files.

jdfits was programmed before the NASA/HEADAS CFITSIO library became widely
available. Today, CFITSIO is easier to use and already installed on many user's
machines.

While jdfits is a stand-alone library and can be included in any program, we
recommend to use CFITSIO for all new work. jdfits is still used in the marx
program (The marx web page is at <http://space.mit.edu/cxc/marx/>), but even there
new functions now depend on CFITSIO.

jdfits is still under development.  Please send all
comments, modifications, bug reports, or bug fixes to davis@space.mit.edu so
that they may be incorporated into the distribution.

There is no documentaton on the library.  After building it, you should be
left with a file called `jdfits.h' (and the library!) which is to be included
into any file that uses routines from library.  Look in this file for what
functions are available.

See `makefits.c' for an example of using the library to create a fits
file and `fitsdump.c' to read one.
