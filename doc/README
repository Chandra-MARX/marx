The documentation in this folder is far from complete. We strongly
encourage users to check out the marx webpage at
http://space.mit.edu/cxc/marx
for a complete documentation.
The reason not to include it here is that the documentation has a lot
more dependencies than marx itself because it also shows how marx interacts
with CIAO and with with analysis packages like ISIS, XSPEC and Sherpa.
Also, several graphics packages are required to build the figures contained
in the documentation.


Files here include:

   marx.html:  A pointer to the MARX web page
   dump.txt:   format of marx binary file output
   source.tex: Mathematics of the various source models.
   hrma/:      information about the HRMA
