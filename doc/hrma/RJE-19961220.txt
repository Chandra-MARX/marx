I still don't know where the drawings of the quad shutters are;
presumably Jon can rustle some up here, or get some from Kodak.
But here's the info about the axial positions.  There are photos
of the aft HRMA structure on page 

	http://hea-www.harvard.edu/asctrw/pix_hetg_install.html

on the WWW.  They show which corner has the hinge, which way
opening shutters rotate (with angular momentum vector parallel to
the x-ray propagation direction; our Z axis).

					good luck;

Jon,

John didn't realize that we were looking for fairly accurate numbers and
the ones in the table below are in fact the distances to the -X side of the
Y-axis shutters.  The Z-axis shutters are 0.375" in the +X direction from
the Y-axis shutters.  These numbers are nominal dimensions and the actual
tolerance between the blades and the CAP midplane is in the order of +/-
0.250".  Also, note the typo for MP6; it's 118.25".
