Correction of HRMA Axial Data

On 7 September Lester received information from Tom Casey
of Kodak(phone info) on the offsets of the optics from the
nominal(ideal) spacings. I took this data and computed
optic offsets from the CAP reference surfaces, datums A(for P's)
and D(for H's). I have corrected some typos and added some info
to that E-Mail and repeat it below:

Subject: Optic Positions per Tom Casey

The nominal HRMA design places the apertures of the optics 80.8mm apart.
This is for an optic with aperture length 838.2mm(33in exactly). So the
nominal optic spacing, accounting for the fact that the optics are 2mm
oversized on each end(length=842.2), is 76.8mm. The optic spacing
to the CAP mid-plane is therefore 38.4mm, nominal.

Tom Casey has computed, based on HDOS data, offsets of each optic
from the nominal axial spacing. These offsets were transmitted to
Lester over the phone and are as follows:

      P1/H1:    +11.30mm/+0.16mm
      P3/H3:     -0.23mm/-0.26mm
      P4/H4:     -3.54mm/-0.11mm
      P6/H6:     -8.57mm/-2.00mm

                 where a POSITIVE value indicates a shift TOWARDS
                 the FOCUS

Given the above numbers and sign convention, we can compute the spacing
between the ends of the optics and the CAP mid-plane. We can also
compute the spacing between the ends of the optics and the CAP datum
planes, based on the nominal CAP thickness of 50.0mm.


                                                            (P CAP to MP +

I checked the P6 to Datum A "as-measured" yesterday in the log book, and
found out that the value was 0.9435"(23.965mm). Their "nominal" for this
was 0.943"(23.952mm). I did some checking and was given 8 Kodak drawings
detailing mirror interface data. The basic data on axial position
is given below for the 8 mirrors(the data were in inches, I converted to mm.

   Mirror     Offset from CAP(in)    Offset from CAP(mm)
       P1           0.160                  4.064   (Ref Datum A)
       P3           0.614                 15.596   (Ref Datum A)
       P4           0.756                 19.202   (Ref Datum A)
       P6           0.943                 23.952   (Ref Datum A)

       H3           0.391                  9.931   (Ref Datum D)
       H4           0.397                 10.084   (Ref Datum D)
       H6           0.323                  8.204   (Ref Datum D)

I re-computed the CORRECTED table below for the 4 shells, using the
AS-BUILT CAP thickness of 49.911mm.

                                                            (P CAP to MP +
                                                              H CAP to MP + 4)
              P's to CAP                 H's to CAP          838.2mm aperture
         Datum "A"   Midplane       Midplane    Datum "D"     P-H Separation
         ---------   --------       --------    ---------     --------------
Shell 1    4.064mm   29.019mm       35.293mm     10.338mm        68.312mm
Shell 3   15.596mm   40.551mm       34.886mm      9.931mm        79.437mm
Shell 4   19.202mm   44.157mm       35.039mm     10.084mm        83.196mm
Shell 6   23.952mm   48.907mm       33.159mm      8.204mm        86.066mm

I know that this will perturb Terry's analyses and Lester's 1G XRCF in
particular, but better to catch it now.
