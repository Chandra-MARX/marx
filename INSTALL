MARX Installation Notes.

Before building marx, you need to decide where you want to install it.
A good choice for a multi-user system is under /usr/local/.  If you
want to install it for personal use, something like $HOME/marx/ might
be more appropriate.  For the purposes of this document, assume that
it is to be installed under /usr/local/.  Start by running the
configure script as follows:

   # ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

This step may take a few minutes to complete, depending upon the speed
of your system.  This script probes your system to see what tools and
libraries are available, and then creates the necessary makefiles.  If
all went well, you will see something like:

   MARX executables will be installed in /usr/local/bin/.
   MARX documentation will be installed in /usr/local/share/doc/marx/.
   MARX data files will be installed in /usr/local/share/marx/data/.
   MARX parameter files will be installed in /usr/local/share/marx/pfiles/.

   To continue the build process, run `make`.

The next step in the build process is to run the `make` program:

   # make

This will build the marx executables and needed libraries but will not
install them.  Assuming a successful build, run `make install` to
perform the installation:

   # make install

NOTE: This step may require root privileges if you do not have write
permission to create files under the selected installation directory.
So, you may have to perform the install script using something like

   # sudo make install

===========================================================================
MARXRSP
===========================================================================
Note: You do not need marxrsp to run marx.  This program is optional!!

To build marxrsp, you first need to get the CFITSIO library if you do
not already have it.  It is not included in this distribution because
you probably already have it if you have ftools.  In any case, after
locating your cfitsio distribution, or creating CFITSIO, do:

   cd marxrsp
   <edit the Makefile>
   make
   make install

PROBLEMS
====================================================================

NeXT Problems
-------------
For some reason, rfl refuses to compile under NeXT.  I think it is
a bug in the linker on this system.  If you run into a problem, edit
marx/Makefile to skip building rfl.

Ultrix Problems
---------------
Ultrix cc has a bug in the optimizer causing it to generate bad
assembly code, which the assembler (as) trips over and coredumps.  On
this system, it is recommended that before configuring, set the CFLAGS
environment variable to -g.  That is, do:

   # setenv CFLAGS -g
   # ./configure

Solaris
-------
There appears to be a bug in the libc function `qsort'.  We have not
actually experienced any problems with the bug but `purify' does report an
``unitialiized memory read'' in the qsort function.  This is __NOT__ a
result of a bug in MARX.  If you do experience a coredump of MARX and
the dump occurs while the qsort function is executing, let me know and
I will supply a custom bug-free version of qsort in the next MARX release.
